### What kind of talks are we looking for?

Talks at Droidcon Boston 2019 come in 3 different flavors: a keynote, a 25min talk and a 50min talk. Droidcon Boston will have two parallel tracks:

* The "Green Track" which will focus on technical talks about native Android development.
* The "Rainbow Track" which will have a broader range of topics, such as: mobile development processes, design, cross-platform development for Android, etc.

Before you submit your talk, have a look at the slides from previous Droidcon Boston events to get a feeling for what kind of talks were given in the past.
